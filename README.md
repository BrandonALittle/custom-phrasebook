There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Phrase Notes ##
  An application for recording foreign language translations of phrases.

## Users ##
  For people who want to keep track of phrases they have translated, either for study or for re-use.

## Summary ##
  This customized phrasebook application helps you to create translations and record them for future use, essentially helping you skip the dictionary and grammar books and go straight to using the language. 

## Problem ##
  If you are studying a foreign language, static one-book-fits-all phrasebooks can be inadequate. This is especially true if the people you interact with don't actually use those phrases (i.e. they say it another way), due to locale, dialect, or colloquial slang. Furthermore, language classes teach from a bottom-up perspective, but daily interactions in a foreign language consist of repetitive usage of phrases that can range from simple to complex in terms of grammar and vocabulary. One finds that learning translates slowly from the classroom to real life. 

## Solution ##
  This application allows a user to get a foreign language translation of something they wish to say, which is stored for future use or study. A user can add to their phrasebook translations which they use in real life, and develop their learning around usage of phrases straight from their particular circumstances. In this way, they can focus on fluency first and accuracy second.
